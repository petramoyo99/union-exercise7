# Union and Union ALL SQL exercise 7
This repo contains my handwritten work for exercise 7 on set oparation:

-**UNION**: Combines SELECT queryresults and automatically removes duplicate rows.
-**UNION ALL**: Combinesresults but keeps allrows (including duplicates) - usually performs better
Key rules I practiced:
-Both queries must return the same number of columns
-Columns must have compatible data types
